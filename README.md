# Portfolio

Welcome to my Portfolio project! This repository is a work in progress, where I am building a personal portfolio to showcase my skills, projects, and growth as a developer. The goal of this project is to create a central platform where I can share my work, demonstrate my abilities, and provide potential collaborators or employers with a comprehensive view of my skills.

## Project Structure

Currently, the project includes:

- **React Application**: Set up with Create React App as a foundation for further development.
- **Components Folder**: Where individual React components will be organized as the project grows.
- **Styled Components**: Basic styles and structure using Styled Components for modern and modular CSS management.
- **Biome Configuration**: Ensuring code quality and consistency. (Replaces previous use of ESLint and Prettier)

## Goals

In the future, this portfolio will include:

- **Detailed Project Showcase**: Sections dedicated to presenting specific projects I've worked on, including descriptions, technologies used, and key takeaways.
- **About Me**: A page that describes my background, skills, and journey in tech.
- **Contact Information**: Links to connect with me on various social media platforms or send me a direct message.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring that the site looks great on all devices.
- **Interactive Elements**: Components that demonstrate my skills in front-end development, possibly including animations or interactive features.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/raphaeldebot/portfolio.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd portfolio
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Future Plans

This portfolio will serve as a live showcase of my ongoing journey and projects. As I develop new skills and complete more projects, this repository will grow to reflect that. Follow this repository to see updates as they happen!
> Note: Biome is now used in place of ESLint and Prettier to streamline the code quality and formatting process in a single tool.
